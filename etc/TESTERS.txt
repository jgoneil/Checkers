Hello and thank you for testing our game! Below are instructions on how to run the system:

1) The file should be found on the desktop of your computer. Please open up the command prompt and cd onto the desktop
2) Unzip the files either through the windows file system or from the command line. You should now have a folder with the system on the desktop.
3) cd into the folder and type the command dir. You should see a file called 'pom.xml'. This is needed for execution. 
  a) If you do not see this file, please ask for assistance otherwise, continue to step 4.
4) type the following command into the command prompt: mvn compile exec:java
  a) This should start the game and the system will begin listening for connections
5) Open a web browser and go to the following address: localhost:4567
  a) You should see webcheckers now running in the web browser
6) To play the game, either open another web browser or open a tab in incognito mode to have a second session available for use. The address again for the second browser is: localhost:4567
